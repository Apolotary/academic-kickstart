I am a Kyrgyzstani-born multidisciplinary researcher and creative technologist, focused on spatial and social computing, human-computer interaction, immersive media, and digital art. 

I am currently doing my postdoc at Digital Nature Group, University of Tsukuba, where I investigate how advances in handheld and wearable technologies are changing the ways we interact and perceive each other online. My ultimate goal is to build systems and applications that reform the traditional social media interfaces towards a better form of interaction, communication, and a sense of being together. 

Outside of my main work, I serve as an educator, organizer, and content producer at ACM SIGGRAPH, as well as a creator and manager of different tech, art, and science communities around the globe, including one of the largest meetups on mechanical keyboards in Japan, first computer graphics conference in Kyrgyzstan, and one of the first AI+XR tech hackathons in Tokyo.
